# /tech-guides/flutter.md â€“ Flutter Mobile Tech Guide

This guide defines Flutter-specific conventions for mobile development. It supports scalable UI and task protocols outlined in `/frontend/ARCHITECT.md`.

---

## âœ… Framework

* Flutter 3+ with Dart SDK
* Uses Material 3
* Modular file layout with `lib/`

---

## ðŸ§­ File Structure

```
/frontend/flutter/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/             # Entry, theming, routing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features/        # Domain modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/         # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/        # API, auth, storage
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ models/          # DTOs, schemas
```

* Organize by domain inside `/features/`
* Prefer `riverpod` or `bloc` for state

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling

* Use ThemeData tokens defined in `app/theme.dart`
* Follow Material 3 design
* Use `MediaQuery` and `SafeArea` for responsiveness
* Respect accessibility: focus, semantics, contrast

---

## ðŸ§  State Management

* Preferred: `flutter_riverpod`
* Alternative: `bloc`, `provider`
* Avoid setState except for local UI tweaks

---

## ðŸ§¾ Forms & Validation

* Use `flutter_form_builder` or `reactive_forms`
* Use Zod-equivalent validation logic via service class or Dart packages
* Show errors inline; validate on blur and submit

---

## ðŸ”Œ API Integration

* Use `dio` or `http` for API calls
* Create API services in `/services/`
* Expose reactive hooks via Riverpod
* Typed models in `/models/`

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

* Use `flutter_test` + `mockito`
* Coverage: unit, widget, and golden tests
* Place tests in `/test/` folder
* Minimum 90% coverage

---

## ðŸª„ Tooling

* Dart `analyzer`, `lint`, `build_runner`
* Use `freezed` + `json_serializable` for models
* VSCode or Android Studio recommended

---
