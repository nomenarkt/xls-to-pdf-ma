# /tech-guides/react.md â€“ React + Next.js Tech Guide

This guide defines implementation best practices for all React-based web UIs, including those built with Next.js (App Router). It provides Codex with stack-specific conventions and complements the `/frontend/AGENT.md` and `/frontend/ARCHITECT.md` contracts.

---

## âœ… Framework

* React 18+
* Next.js (App Router only)
* Server Components with "use client" boundary for interactivity

---

## ðŸ§­ File Structure

```
/web/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/              # App Router structure (admin, user, auditor)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/       # Shared component library
â””â”€â”€ pages/            # Static content (optional)
```

* All code lives under `/frontend/web/`
* Use RSCs by default, mark interactive components with `"use client"`

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling

* Tailwind CSS with design tokens
* Tokens defined in `/shared/theme.ts`
* Never hardcode spacing, colors, or fonts
* Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes

---

## ðŸ§  State Management

* Use React Query for server state
* Local state via `useState` or `useReducer`
* Context allowed for scoped session state
* Avoid global stores (e.g., Redux) unless scoped and justified

---

## ðŸ§¾ Forms & Validation

* Use `react-hook-form`
* Validation via Zod schemas from `/shared/schemas/`
* Show inline validation and async/server errors
* Mark required fields, use accessible labels

---

## ðŸ”Œ API Integration

* Never call fetch/axios directly in UI components
* Wrap API logic in `/shared/api/` and expose via typed hooks from `/shared/hooks/`
* Use query/mutation naming: `useCreateUser`, `useListOrders`, etc.
* Handle loading, error, and success states

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

* Use React Testing Library (RTL)
* Write tests for:

  * Rendering props and variants
  * Click, type, submit interactions
  * Query/mutation effects
  * Accessibility (focus, labels, roles)
* Minimum 90% coverage enforced by CI
* Test files co-located: `ComponentName.tsx` â†’ `ComponentName.test.tsx`

---

## ðŸª„ Tooling

* TypeScript strict mode enabled
* ESLint with `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`
* Prettier auto-formatting
* `theme.ts` for token enforcement

---
